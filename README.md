# Database-Management-System-The-Examination
This computer program “The Examination” is a database management system,
accessible to both the student class and the batch class. The access is absolute
and complete to the batch class while it’s limited to the student class. It is
extremely user friendly as it provides immediate access to the student’s batch
and provides a safe route for information to the examination organizers.

The entire program is menu driven making it easier to optimally utilize for the
students.

Another feature is that one can jump from any function to another directly by
just pressing the keys corresponding to that particular function.

Although aimed to be sample for utilization for an examination, its versatile
nature makes it a potential for other coaching centers as well.
